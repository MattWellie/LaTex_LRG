At some point I'll work out what kind of license this should have

##Requirements and testing
pdflatex
tkinter (python graphics package)
Python 2.7

##What it does
platform independent
requires outputFiles folder to be created

##Who its for

##How to operate it
python XML_gui.py
use the help tab on the window if it helps

##Issue Tracker
stumbles on exons numbered with letters (e.g. 14a)

happy hunting
